[See the app here.](https://papaya-lamington-fca010.netlify.app/)

# About
This project is a response to a brief at Medieinstitutet in Gothenburg. In groups of three, we were tasked with creating a small React app. The purpose of the app was our choice.

Food-finder takes input from the user to create a list of ingredients avilable to them in their kitchen. It then communicates with the Spoonacular API to get a selection of recipes that can be cooked with those ingredients. The recipes are displayed to the user along with which ingredients are used and which ingredients are missing from the user's selection. The user can then click on each recipe to see more details and either the recipe mthod or a link to the website where it is hosted.


# Project setup
Food-finder uses Vite, TypeScript, React, React Router and Styled Components.
